# About Me

I'm a computer engineer who loves building, learning, and understanding how things work — not just using them, but breaking them down to their core.

I moved to the U.S. from India when I was 18, completely on my own. That experience shaped how I approach everything: I adapt quickly, I learn fast, and I figure things out by diving in headfirst. Whether I’m installing Arch Linux, leading a dev team, or learning how to sail, I see every challenge as a chance to grow.

My work spans full-stack web development, artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and hardware. But more than any specific skill, what defines me is **curiosity**. I’m obsessed with the “why” behind the “what.” I don’t just install an OS — I learn how the partition tables work under the hood. I don’t just drive — I understand torque converters, gear ratios, and engine behavior. I chose computer engineering over computer science because I didn’t just want to code — I wanted to understand the machines we run that code on.

I like doing things the hard way, because they teach me more. Instead of paying for a $30 oil change, I’ll do it myself — not just to save money, but to see how the engine’s aging, how dirty the oil is, and how my tools work. That’s the kind of mindset I bring to every project.

I also document everything I learn — from technical tutorials and random curiosities to personal journals. I'm building a personal knowledge management system called **The Quintacle** to organize all of this: Markdown files, notes, health logs, insights about airplanes or astronomy — everything gets tied together into a Chroma vector database so I can query my own life. Eventually, I want my own AI assistant that doesn’t just answer general questions, but gives context-aware, personalized insights based on who I am and what I’ve learned.

That mindset carries into my health, too. I don’t just work out — I analyze how food choices affect recovery, performance, and focus. I added avocados for iron after noticing head rushes. I avoid red meat for religious reasons, so I find nutritional workarounds that suit my values. I was diagnosed with cervical spondylosis and told not to lift — so I pivoted to calisthenics, stayed consistent, and kept my strength up.

In teams, I often take the lead — explaining complex ideas simply, training new members, or just creating clarity when things get messy. But I also love being the least experienced person in the room. If there’s something I don’t know, I’ll ask, dig in, and figure it out.
