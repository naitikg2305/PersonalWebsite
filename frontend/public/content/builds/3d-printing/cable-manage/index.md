## 3D-Printed Cable Management System for Standing Desk  
I designed and printed a set of components to keep my standing desk setup clean, mobile, and wire-free. The goal was to keep all wires tucked underneath the desk, so the entire setup could move up and down smoothly without clutter.

**Components:**
- **Custom Laptop Adapter Holder**  
  Screws underneath the desk to hold the laptop charger in place, eliminating dangling cables.

- **Printed Wire Organizers**  
  Used pre-existing models to route and secure wires under the desk.

This setup keeps all my devices—monitors, keyboard, laptop, lamp—connected without mess, even as the desk moves.
