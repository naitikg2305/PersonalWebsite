## üìê Head Measurements & Base Geometry
- Head circumference: ~60 cm
- Side-to-side (sagittal width): 18 cm
- Front-to-back: 20 cm

### Elliptical Crown Design
- Used 3-point ellipse: center + front point + side point
- Dimensions chosen: **20 cm by 18 cm ellipse**
- The shell was then thickened and trimmed using `Split Body` and `Delete Face`

## üß± Structural Thickness & Printing Rules
- Layer thickness: **0.4 mm**
- Wall thickness: **2.0 mm** (for durability and clean slicing)
- Fillet radius: **0.5 mm** for all exposed edge rounds

> Important: Make all wall thicknesses a **multiple of nozzle size** to avoid print artifacts

## üß† Design Tricks & Challenges

### Deleting a Subsection
- Make a circle sketch over area
- Use **Extrude > Cut** mode to delete a portion cleanly

###  Arched Beams for Stability ‚Äì Step-by-Step Construction

This section outlines the detailed steps for designing and attaching the overhead and front-facing arcs that stabilize the NaviGatr headset.

#### üîÑ Overview:
We used Fusion 360's `3-Point Arc` tool to construct two major arched beams:
- **Overhead arch**: Adds vertical stability from ear to ear
- **Forward beam**: Connects the top center to the front-mounted camera



#### ‚úçÔ∏è Step-by-Step Instructions:

**1. Create the Overhead Arc**
- Open a new sketch
- Select the plane **facing forward (frontal view)** of the head
- Use the `3-Point Arc` tool to:
  - Select left ear anchor point
  - Select right ear anchor point
  - Set third (top) point **~8 cm above** center for crown height

**2. Extrude the Arc**
- Finish the sketch
- Select the arc profile
- Use `Extrude` **both directions** symmetrically
- Create a flat rectangular surface along the arc

**3. Thicken the Arc into a Beam**
- Use the `Thicken` tool to give it structure (e.g., 2‚Äì3 mm thick)

**4. Add Forward Beam**
- Start a new sketch on a plane parallel to the sagittal midline
- Use another `3-Point Arc` to:
  - Connect the **top center of the headband**
  - To the **forward camera mount point**
- Extrude both ways, then thicken like above

**5. Press-Pull Fine Tuning**
- If arc ends don‚Äôt perfectly meet the headband:
  - Use the `Press Pull` tool
  - Hide other bodies for precision
  - Select the **small rectangular cross-sectional face at the end of the arc**
  - Pull or push the face until it intersects cleanly into the headband

**6. Final Cleanup**
- Use `Thicken` on the main headband base to hide or eliminate protruding geometry or weak gaps from the arc intersections

## üß∞ STL Import & Fusion Workflow
- Import STLs via `Insert > Mesh > STL`
- Convert mesh to body for editing
- To attach STLs to the base, create **rectangular standoffs** and **combine** with headband base
- Used `Press Pull` tool to merge intersecting components cleanly

---

## üî© Mounting Holes & Screws
- Pi and Coral TPU: **M3 screws** (3mm)
- Pi Camera: **2.5mm screws**
- Created mounting holes and positioned standoffs accordingly

> Used M3 brass inserts for secure mounting of electronics

---

## üí® Fan & Pi Mounting
- **Initial design** featured a Pi case with open-air fan mounts
- Used **2x 30mm fans** placed above the Pi board for better airflow
- Feedback noted that open fans could **catch hair**, so a redesign was implemented

### Redesign:
- Merged the fan-mount Pi case with a GPIO screen top
- GPIO screen housing sits **above the fans**, acting as a protective lid
- A hole was designed into the top cover to pass GPIO pins from the Pi to the screen

---

## üß± Component Mounting Overview ‚Äì NaviGatr Headset
This document details the mounting strategy and design notes for each key hardware component in the NaviGatr headset. All modules were either custom-designed or adapted to fit the geometry and constraints of the 3D printed headband structure.

## üîã Power Bank

- **Type:** Anker 10,000 mAh USB-C power bank  
- **Weight:** ~250g  
- **Dimensions:** 110 x 66 x 26 mm

### Mount Design:
- Rectangular case designed to clamp securely onto the **rear arc** of the elliptical headband
- Clamps use flexible arms and shallow groove interface for grip
- Power cable is routed cleanly through designated slots to the Pi on the opposite side

> This rear placement balances the front-heavy mass of the Pi, screen, and fans, making the headset more ergonomic.

## üß† Raspberry Pi + GPIO Screen Module

### Structure:
- **Base:** Predesigned Raspberry Pi case
- **Top Cover:** Custom-designed to hold:
  - GPIO touchscreen display
  - Dual 30mm fans for active cooling

### Design Notes:
- The **top section** height was increased to accommodate the GPIO screen‚Äôs standoffs
- A cutout was added to route GPIO ribbon wires upward without bending
- **Lower half** had to be carefully planned so the **fans do not interfere** with GPIO pin access

> This hybrid case allowed full visibility and interaction with the screen, while preserving airflow and GPIO usability.

## üì∑ Pi Camera
- Mounted on a forward-facing arc using a predesigned holder
- Positioned at eye-level for accurate vision tasks
- Ribbon cable routed through internal tracks to the Pi case in the rear

---

## üß† Coral TPU
- Housed in a predesigned TPU case
- Mounted near the side or base of the headband
- USB cable routed beneath the fans to minimize clutter

---

## üßä Fans (2x 30mm)
- Positioned directly above Raspberry Pi board
- Mounted beneath the GPIO screen
- Passive grills allow air intake while screen housing acts as protective lid

> Their placement ensures direct airflow to the Pi while minimizing dust and hair contact.

---

## ü™õ General Assembly Notes
- All modules are mounted via M3 screws or zip ties
- Openings and wire channels were integrated into the base model for clean cable management
- Components are modular and removable for maintenance


---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Assembly Strategy
- The GPIO screen module fits onto the Pi case via standoffs
- Camera is mounted forward and routed through arch beam
- TPU and battery mount opposite each other for balance
- Fans face upward for passive convection through top mesh
- All components zip-tied or screw-secured to standoffs

---



### Print Troubleshooting
- A1 printer bed-slinging caused weak contact
- Switched to broader surface area for better adhesion
- Added brim/raft and slowed first-layer speeds

![alt text](image_202675.png) 
- failed orientation

![alt text](image_206207.png)
- more wasted material for supports but slinging adhesion

This custom 3D printed assembly forms the physical backbone of NaviGatr ‚Äî balancing function, thermal safety, and wearable comfort.
