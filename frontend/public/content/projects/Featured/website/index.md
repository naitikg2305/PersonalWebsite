# Building an AI Chatbot with Frontend and Backend Integration

This guide documents how to build an AI-powered chatbot with full integration across backend, frontend, and Markdown content-driven design. It is written to help new developers understand the entire pipeline, from file-based content loading to chatbot API responses.

---

## 🧱 Project Structure Overview

```
/public/content/
    /about/
    /employment/
    /education/
/src/
    /components/
        Home.tsx
        WorkExperienceSection.tsx
        EducationSection.tsx
        ChatbotButton.tsx
        ChatSection.tsx
    /lib/
        getWorkExperiences.ts
        getEducations.ts
        readExperience.ts
        readEducation.ts
    /types/
        experience.ts
        education.ts
    /app/
        /experience/[slug].tsx
        /education/[slug].tsx
```

---

## 📄 Step 1: Store Content in Markdown

Each work experience or education entry is stored in a `.md` file with frontmatter:

```md
---
title: "University of Maryland"
order: 1
company: "University of Maryland"
dates: "Aug 2021 – May 2025 (Expected)"
location: "College Park, MD"
slug: "university-of-maryland"
summaryPoints:
  - Pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering
  - Coursework: AI, OS, ML, Embedded Systems
  - Led student teams on AI/full-stack projects
---
```

---

## 📚 Step 2: Create Content Loaders

We use `gray-matter` to parse markdown files in `getWorkExperiences.ts` and `getEducations.ts`.

```ts
// getEducations.ts
export function getEducations(): Education[] {
  const dir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public/content/education');
  const files = fs.readdirSync(dir);

  const educations = files.map((filename) => {
    const file = fs.readFileSync(path.join(dir, filename), 'utf8');
    const { data } = matter(file);
    return data as Education;
  });

  educations.sort((a, b) => (a.order ?? 999) - (b.order ?? 999));
  return educations;
}
```

```ts
// readEducation.ts
export function readEducation(slug: string) {
  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public/content/education', `${slug}.md`);
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
  const { content, data } = matter(fileContent);
  return { content, data };
}
```

---

## 💻 Step 3: Frontend Display

Each section is a React component that renders data from the backend.

### EducationSection.tsx

```tsx
export default function EducationSection({ educations }: { educations: Education[] }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {educations.map((edu) => (
        <div key={edu.slug}>
          <h3>{edu.title}</h3>
          <p>{edu.dates} — {edu.location}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Home.tsx Integration

```tsx
<EducationSection educations={educations} />
<WorkExperienceSection experiences={workExperiences} />
```

### Page.tsx (Server-side)

```tsx
const educations = getEducations();
const workExperiences = getWorkExperiences();
return <Home workExperiences={workExperiences} educations={educations} />;
```

---

## 🤖 Step 4: Implementing Chatbot Backend

In `/pages/api/chat.ts`:

```ts
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { prompt } = req.body;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
  });

  res.status(200).json({ text: response.choices[0].message.content });
}
```

---

## 🧠 Step 5: Chatbot Frontend Logic

### ChatSection.tsx

```tsx
const [input, setInput] = useState('');
const [response, setResponse] = useState('');

async function sendPrompt() {
  const res = await fetch('/api/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: input })
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  setResponse(data.text);
}
```

### ChatbotButton.tsx

```tsx
<button onClick={toggleChat}>Ask</button>
```

---

## 🌐 Styling

Use `landing.module.css` for dark terminal-style UI with:
- `.terminal`
- `.experienceCard`
- `.navTitle`

---

## ✅ Final Notes

- Ensure every markdown file has a valid `slug`.
- Always pass arrays to components that `.map()`.
- Use `remark-gfm` to render bullet points and Markdown properly.
- Make sure dynamic routes like `[slug].tsx` use the correct file loader.

> Now you have a working site with a chatbot, content-driven pages, and real frontend-backend integration.

# 🧠 Portfolio Codebase: Structure, Routing, and Content Rendering

This file documents the architecture and logic behind Naitik Gupta’s personal website — including how work experiences, education entries, and markdown content are structured, routed, and rendered.

---

## 🗂️ File & Directory Layout

```
/app
  /experience
    /[slug]/page.tsx         → Dynamic route for each work experience
  /education
    /[slug]/page.tsx         → Dynamic route for each education entry

/components
  Home.tsx                   → Main page that renders About, Experience, Education
  WorkExperienceSection.tsx  → Displays all work experiences
  EducationSection.tsx       → Displays all education entries

/lib
  getWorkExperiences.ts      → Reads all experience .md files
  readExperience.ts          → Reads one experience .md file
  getEducations.ts           → Reads all education .md files
  readEducation.ts           → Reads one education .md file

/public
  /content
    /experience/*.md         → Markdown for each job
    /education/*.md          → Markdown for each school
    /about/about.md          → Markdown for bio
```

---

## 🧠 Component Behavior

### Home.tsx

This is the main frontend page, composed of:
- A floating name + quote animation using `useEffect` and index slicing
- A fixed top navbar that fades in on scroll
- Sections rendered in order:
  - **About** → markdown terminal (`about.md`)
  - **Experience** → list of jobs (`WorkExperienceSection`)
  - **Education** → list of schools (`EducationSection`)
  - **Chat** → AI chatbot block

Props passed to `Home.tsx`:
```ts
interface HomeProps {
  workExperiences: Experience[];
  educations: Experience[];
}
```

### WorkExperienceSection.tsx & EducationSection.tsx

Each uses the same terminal-style design:
```tsx
<div className={styles.contentContainer} id="education">
  <div className={styles.terminal}>
    <div className={styles.terminalHeader}>education.md</div>
    <div className={styles.terminalBody}>
      {educations.map(...)}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Each item includes:
- `title — company`
- `dates • location`
- `summaryPoints[]`
- Link to `Read more →` via slug

---

## 🧭 Routing Strategy

### Dynamic Pages (`app/experience/[slug]/page.tsx` and `app/education/[slug]/page.tsx`)

Each `[slug]` page reads from the corresponding Markdown file using:
```ts
const { content, data } = readExperience(params.slug);
// OR
const { content, data } = readEducation(params.slug);
```

They use the same UI logic:
```tsx
<h1>{data.title}</h1>
<h2>{data.company}</h2>
<p><em>{data.dates} • {data.location}</em></p>
<hr />
<ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]} rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>
  {content}
</ReactMarkdown>
```

Each Markdown file sits at:
```
/public/content/experience/<slug>.md
/public/content/education/<slug>.md
```

The slug must match the filename.

---

## 📄 Example Markdown Frontmatter

Each `.md` file has YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "University of Maryland"
company: "University of Maryland"
dates: "Aug 2021 – May 2025 (Expected)"
location: "College Park, MD"
slug: "university-of-maryland"
summaryPoints:
  - Pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering
  - Coursework: AI, OS, ML, etc.
  - Led student teams on AI and full-stack projects
---
```

---

## 🧾 Markdown Render Pipeline

- Files are read with `gray-matter` to extract `data` and `content`.
- Markdown content is rendered using:
  ```tsx
  <ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]} rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>
  ```
- This allows:
  - GitHub-flavored markdown
  - Syntax-highlighted code blocks
  - Inline images and formatting
  - Full layout control via `.markdownContent` CSS class

---

## 🎨 Styling Notes

All sections use a terminal-style theme, defined in `landing.module.css`.

Key styles:
```css
.contentContainer {
  padding-top: 100vh;
  padding-bottom: 4rem;
}

.terminal {
  background-color: #000000e6;
  border: 1px solid #00ff00;
  padding: 2rem;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px #00ff00;
}

.terminalHeader {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #00ff00;
}

.terminalBody {
  color: #00ff00;
  font-family: monospace;
}
```

To tighten spacing between Experience and Education:
```css
.educationSpacingFix {
  padding-top: 2rem !important;
}
```

---

## ✅ Summary of Key Techniques

- File-based CMS using Markdown in `/public/content`
- Dynamic route loading via `[slug]/page.tsx` under `app/`
- ReactMarkdown + GFM + syntax highlighting
- Consistent terminal-style UI reused across sections
- Experience and Education handled identically, separated only by folder and route

This system is minimal, scalable, and Markdown-friendly — ready to expand into more content types like projects, builds, or blogs.

# 🧠 Full Developer Resume Guide for the Personal Website

This file documents everything a new developer needs to know to understand and build upon this Next.js React-based personal website. It captures our decisions, architecture, folder layout, problems encountered, and styling systems.

---

## 🧱 React + Next.js Stack Overview

- **React Version**: 18+
- **Next.js Version**: 13+ with the `/app` directory structure
- **Styling**: CSS Modules (`landing.module.css`), global styles (`globals.css`)
- **Markdown Rendering**: Using `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`

---

## 🔄 Fetch vs. getStaticProps: What We Learned

### ❌ `getStaticProps` Issue
We initially used `getStaticProps` to load content like `about.md`, but it is server-side only. This meant **animations and scroll-based UI logic** (like navbar hiding or typing effects) had to run client-side, which conflicted with `getStaticProps`. The page either wouldn’t hydrate properly or animations broke.

### ✅ `fetch()` Solution
We switched to using `fetch()` **client-side** to load markdown from the `/public` folder. This allows scroll-based rendering, animation timing, and dynamic behavior **while still loading content from markdown**.

---

## 🏠 Main Page (`Home.tsx` inside `/components`)

This page handles:

- Typing animation for name (`Naitik Gupta`)
- Showing a quote after name types out
- Navbar that appears after scrolling
- `about.md` loading using `fetch()`
- Injecting markdown into a custom terminal-style component
- Rendering work experiences using a `WorkExperienceSection`

---

## 💼 Work Experience Design

### 🔨 Folder Setup

Markdown files like `zillion.md`, `engineering-it.md`, and `clarkambassador.md` are stored in:

```
/public/content/experience/
```

Each file contains **frontmatter** like this:

```md
---
title: Zillion Technologies
company: Zillion
dates: Summer 2024
location: Hybrid
slug: zillion
summaryPoints:
  - Worked on vector database
  - Handled SharePoint pipeline
  - Used ChromaDB + OpenAI
---

Full description goes here.
```

### 🧠 What Is a Slug?
The `slug` becomes the URL for the experience page. For example:

```
slug: zillion ➜ /experience/zillion
```

### 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Build Time**: `getWorkExperiences.ts` reads all `.md` files and parses their frontmatter
2. **Homepage**: `WorkExperienceSection.tsx` shows blurbs with `Read more` links
3. **Route**: Clicking the link routes to `/experience/[slug]` using Next.js dynamic routing
4. **Page**: `readExperience.ts` loads the full markdown file for that slug

```

---

## 🎨 Styling and Animation

- Terminal interface is built with `div.terminal`, `terminalHeader`, and `terminalBody`
- Typing and blinking cursor animations are custom CSS
- Navbar is hidden until scroll offset `> 10px`
- Markdown content is wrapped in a styled `<div>` for scoped formatting

### Markdown Styling via `.markdownContent` wrapper:

```tsx
<div className={styles.markdownContent}>
  <ReactMarkdown>{markdown}</ReactMarkdown>
</div>
```

```css
.markdownContent h1, .markdownContent h2 {
  color: #00ff00;
}

.markdownContent p {
  color: #ffffff;
  line-height: 1.6;
}
```

---

## ✅ How to Add More Work Experiences

1. Create a markdown file in `public/content/experience/`
2. Add frontmatter like `title`, `company`, `dates`, `slug`, and `summaryPoints`
3. It will automatically appear on the homepage
4. `Read more →` will lead to `/experience/[slug]`

---

## 🧠 Next Dev Tasks

- Add more content sections (`Projects`, `Knowledge`, `Builds`) like `WorkExperienceSection`
- Consider adding GitHub repos, badges, or video demos to each project
- Add Google Analytics or Chatbot integration

---

This guide ensures **any new dev** can understand the full scope and resume development confidently.

# Personal Website Setup & Resume Guide


This document captures the current working state of your React/Next.js personal website. It covers folder structure, dynamic content loading, routing setup, and styling practices.

## 🏠 Home Component (`Home.tsx`)


This is the main client-side rendered page that handles:
- Typing animation for your name
- Scroll-based navbar visibility
- Markdown loading from the public folder
- Work experience rendering via a reusable component


## 📁 Routing Overview


You're using the new `/src/app` structure in React 18 / Next.js 13+.

- `layout.tsx` is your root layout.
- `page.tsx` files define routes.
- The `Home.tsx` component is passed props via `page.tsx` in `/app`.


## 💼 Work Experience Setup


Each experience has:
- A Markdown file with frontmatter for title, company, dates, and bullet points
- `getWorkExperiences.ts` reads and parses these files at build time
- `WorkExperienceSection.tsx` renders short blurbs and links to each page


## 🔁 Dynamic Content Loading


- **About Section**: Uses `fetch()` in the browser to load `/public/content/about/about.md`
- **Experience**: Loaded using server-side file system access at build time


## 🎨 Markdown Styling Caveats


`ReactMarkdown` does not support `className` directly unless you use custom components or plugins.
To style markdown:
- Wrap it in a styled div
- Use global styles or override element tags with CSS


## 📂 Folder Structure
```
- src/
  - app/
    - page.tsx       # Loads Home component and passes props
  - components/
    - Home.tsx
    - WorkExperienceSection.tsx
  - lib/
    - getWorkExperiences.ts
    - readExperience.ts
  - styles/
    - landing.module.css
  - types/
    - experience.ts
- public/
  - content/
    - about/about.md
    - experience/zillion.md
    - experience/engineering-it.md
    - experience/clarkambassador.md
```

├── styles
│   └── landing.module.css     # Terminal-style aesthetic
```

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 📦 Content-Based Routing

- Projects are organized into folders under `public/content/projects/Featured/[slug]`.
- Each project has an `index.md` file with YAML frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "NaviGatr"
  summary: "AI vision device for the blind."
  tags: ["AI", "Hardware"]
  youtube: "https://youtu.be/abc123"
  pdfs: ["Final_Report.pdf"]
  stls: ["headset.stl"]
  docs: ["wiring.md"]
  ---
  ```

### 📚 Dynamic Reading

- `getProjects.ts` reads each folder's `index.md` and returns project metadata.
- `readProject.ts` reads and parses a single markdown file with `gray-matter`.

### 🔁 Slug Routing

- The `[slug]/page.tsx` file dynamically renders a detail view for a project using the folder name as the slug.
- Clicking a project card takes you to `/projects/my-project-slug`.

### 🧾 Markdown + Asset Integration

- Uses `ReactMarkdown` and `remark-gfm` to render content.
- Image `![](xyz.jpg)` tags are auto-rewritten to resolve from the correct folder:
  ```ts
  const resolvedSrc = src.startsWith("http") || src.startsWith("data:image")
    ? src
    : `/content/projects/Featured/${params.slug}/${src}`;
  ```

### 🧊 STL + Doc Viewers

- STL files link to a `/stl-viewer` page with query params to render models.
- Markdown docs open in a `/doc-viewer` page for readability.

### 🎯 Project Cards

- The main `/projects/page.tsx` shows all featured projects with title, summary, and image.
- Clicking a card routes to its `[slug]` detail.

---

## 💡 Developer Notes

- Markdown files must contain valid frontmatter.
- Image references in Markdown should be filenames only (e.g., `photo.jpg`).
- Avoid spaces in folder names; use kebab-case or underscores for slugs.
- Assets must be inside `public/` to be directly linkable.

---

## 🛠 Styling Goals (WIP)

- Terminal-like appearance (black background, green/white text).
- Mobile and desktop layout responsiveness.
- Scroll-fixed parallax background image.

---

## ✅ Example Markdown Usage

```markdown
![Circuit Diagram](circuit.jpg)
:link: [Open Source Code](https://github.com/user/repo)
```

---

## 🧪 Base64 Images

- Previously used Base64 images were moved to regular `.jpg` files.
- Use Python script to decode any remaining `.md` base64 files if needed.

---

## 👨‍💻 Final Notes

- Hot reload is instant after first compile.
- Initial dev compile may take 5–6 minutes due to Markdown processing.
- All changes to content files are live after first boot.

# STL Viewer and Markdown Viewer Setup Guide

This document explains the implementation of the **STL Viewer** and **Markdown Viewer** for the personal website project. It is intended for new developers contributing to the project.

---

## 📦 STL Viewer

### Purpose
To display `.stl` files directly in the browser using a 3D model viewer.

### Path
```
/app/stl-viewer/page.tsx
```

### Key Features
- Uses `useSearchParams` to fetch the `file` URL from query string.
- Uses `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` to render STL in 3D.
- Includes OrbitControls for interactive rotation and zoom.
- Includes lighting and auto-centering.

### Sample Usage
```tsx
const fileUrl = searchParams.get('file'); // Ex: /content/builds/section/slug/model.stl
```

### Dependencies Required
Install the following if not already present:
```bash
npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei three
```

### Embedding STL
```tsx
<primitive object={scene} dispose={null} />
```

---

## 📘 Markdown Viewer

### Purpose
To render `.md` documents with embedded images and GitHub-style formatting.

### Path
```
/app/doc-viewer/page.tsx
```

### Key Features
- Reads Markdown files dynamically via `fetch(fileUrl)`.
- Uses `ReactMarkdown` and `remark-gfm` for rendering.
- Automatically resolves relative image paths based on file's location.
- Monospace style and dark background for consistency.

### Sample Image Resolver
```tsx
img: ({ src, alt }) => {
  const resolvedSrc = fileUrl?.split('/').slice(0, -1).join('/') + '/' + safeSrc;
  return <img src={resolvedSrc} alt={alt || ''} ... />
}
```

### Dependencies Required
```bash
npm install react-markdown remark-gfm
```

### Example Use Case
URL: `/doc-viewer?file=/content/projects/Featured/my-project/doc.md`

---

## 🧪 Tips for New Developers

- Always validate your `file` URLs and ensure they are inside `public/content`.
- STL files must have the `.stl` extension; 3MF is not supported by default.
- Markdown viewer works with any `.md` file placed in the correct folder.
- Use `encodeURIComponent` when linking to avoid URL issues with spaces.

---

## 📁 Folder Convention
Make sure your STL and Markdown files are placed in:

```
/public/content/projects/Featured/<slug>/...
/public/content/builds/<section>/<slug>/...
```

---

For further customization, see styles in `landing.module.css` or add your own.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. 🔧 Project Routing

- Uses dynamic route `[slug]/page.tsx` for `/projects` and `/builds`.
- Markdown files stored in `/public/content/...`.
- Slugs are read using `fs.readdirSync()` and `gray-matter`.

### 2. 📁 File Parsing with Frontmatter

Used `gray-matter` to extract metadata:
```ts
const {{ data, content }} = matter(file);
```

### 3. 🧠 Markdown Rendering

- Used `react-markdown` with `remark-gfm`.
- Custom rendering logic for images:
```tsx
img: ({{ src }}) => {{
  const resolvedSrc = `/content/.../${{safeSrc}}`;
  return <img src={{resolvedSrc}} style={{ ... }} />
}}
```

### 4. 🧊 STL Viewer Support

- STL files linked using `/stl-viewer?file=...`.
- 3MF files are **not supported** by STL viewer.

### 5. 📽️ YouTube Support

- **Shorts** don't embed properly by default.
- Convert all URLs to `https://www.youtube.com/embed/<video_id>`.

### 6. 🧠 Interests and Knowledge Sections

- Render all loose `.md` files inside `/content/interests/` and `/content/knowledge/`.
- Use same markdown + image handling as projects.

### 7. 🛠 Build Ordering

- Work experience sorted with `order` field in frontmatter.
- Sorting logic:
```ts
.sort((a, b) => (b.order || 0) - (a.order || 0));
```

### 8. 🎨 Styling and Display

- Centralized in `landing.module.css`.
- Circle-floating image added in Home page with conditional render and positioning.
- Headings styled using standard `h1`, `h2` and `.projectDetail`, `.markdownContent`.

### 9. 🧷 Footer + Navbar Socials

- Added `react-icons`:
  - GitHub: `FaGithub`
  - LinkedIn: `FaLinkedin`
  - Email: `HiOutlineMail`
- Socials shown in `Home.tsx` header or footer.

### 10. 🌐 GitHub Links on Projects

- Added to metadata:
```yaml
github: "https://github.com/user/project"
```
- Rendered with GitHub button using inline styles.

---

## 🧪 Common Errors & Fixes

- ❌ **params.slug used synchronously**
  ✅ Convert page to `async function` and `await readProject(params.slug)`

- ❌ YouTube Shorts not embedding
  ✅ Convert Shorts URL to `https://www.youtube.com/embed/<id>`

- ❌ Image not found
  ✅ Ensure path resolution is relative to `/public/content/...`

---
