## Engineering IT  
**Lead Software Engineer (2024–2025)**  
**Software Development Engineer (2022–2024)**  
_University of Maryland_

### Project: Pinpoint – User Management Platform

Pinpoint is a full-stack web application for managing user access, training validation, and lab tool reservations across UMD engineering labs.

#### 👨‍💻 Key Features:
- **Two-sided Platform:**
  - **Admin Side:** Manage labs, lab admins, machines, machine types, and user permissions.
  - **User Side:**  
    - **Swipe-to-Login:** Users swipe their UID using a magnetic stripe reader. This acts as login and logs both **sign-in and sign-out times** for lab usage tracking.  
    - **Canvas Badges Integration:** Connects swiped UID to university Canvas account via API and verifies badge-based training before granting tool access.  
    - **Training-Gated Access:** Tools are grayed out unless the user has completed the required training modules.  
    - **Tool & Machine Reservation:** Users can search for tools/machines and **reserve** them based on eligibility.

### 🔧 Technical Responsibilities

**Software Development Engineer (2022–2024):**
- Developed and maintained backend and frontend features using **React.js** and **Python Flask/FastAPI**.
- **Key Contribution – Machine Categorization Redesign:**
  - Refactored backend logic to dynamically fetch and group machines by category.
  - Built a structured, collapsible UI view that improved user navigation and readability.
- Integrated **Canvas Badges API** for secure access control.
- Authored internal technical documentation and handled support tickets.

**Lead Engineer (2024–2025):**
- Oversaw the entire project lifecycle — from requirements gathering to deployment.
- Translated feature requests from [features.umd.edu](https://features.umd.edu) into detailed technical tickets and delegated them to the dev team based on expertise (frontend/backend).

#### 🧠 Major Features Implemented as Lead:
1. **Custom Sign-In Reasons with Auto Sign-Out:**
   - Users can select a reason (e.g., "Workshop") from a dropdown when swiping in.
   - Based on the reason, users are automatically signed out after a predefined time (e.g., 15 minutes).
   - Reduced session clutter and improved backend efficiency.

2. **End-of-Session User Feedback Survey:**
   - After signing out, users are prompted with a short usability survey.
   - Helped collect actionable insights to improve UI/UX.

3. **Admin Controls for Custom Sign-In Rules:**
   - Admins can configure available sign-in reasons and assign auto-sign-out timers.
   - Required end-to-end planning:
     - **Backend:** Designed new endpoints and logic for reason handling and auto-timeouts.
     - **Frontend:** Implemented dropdown menus, admin config panels, and sign-out logic.
     - **DevOps:** Coordinated testing and deployment with Dockerized builds.

- Built onboarding modules and tutorial videos to train new hires on our stack and workflow.
- Led resume screening, technical interviews, and final hiring decisions.
